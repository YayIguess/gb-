# gb++
Gameboy emulator written in cpp using a vulkan renderer

WIP - no games currently load as the Vulkan renderer is not complete and thus hsync/vsync is not implemented which is required for the BIOS

# TODO
* Finish Vulkan Renderer
* Add remaining opcodes
* Implement interrupts and Hblank and Vblank
* Add a debugger
* Would be nice to have a GUI
